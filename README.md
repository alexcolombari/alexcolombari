## Hi, I'm Alex

I am a Network and System Administrator with over 7 years of experience , currently based in Germany. My career is built on ensuring the stability and performance of mission-critical systems, moving from core networking to the world of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Observability.

🛠️ Technical Background
Infrastructure: Advanced administration of Linux and Windows Servers, specializing in Active Directory and GPOs.
Networking: Deep expertise in Tier-1 equipment (Mikrotik, Huawei, Juniper) and advanced protocols like BGP and MPLS.
Virtualization & Cloud: Hands-on experience with VMware, Proxmox, Hyper-V, and Docker/Kubernetes, managing environments in AWS and Azure.
Automation & ML: Proficient in Python, PowerShell, and Bash. I have a unique background in Machine Learning R&D, where I developed computer vision models using OpenCV and CNNs with 90%+ accuracy.

🎯 Current Focus: SRE & AIOps
I am currently bridging the gap between traditional operations and intelligent automation.

🎓 Preparing for the HashiCorp Certified: Terraform Associate (Expected March 2026).
📈 Enhancing observability using Zabbix and Grafana.
🤖 Applying my ML background to create more predictable and self-healing infrastructures.
